# Smart Lampposts Simulation

This project is an extension of the [Wireless Sensor Network Simulation](https://github.com/stan-v/wsn-simulation). The wireless sensor network is applied in a practical case of smart lampposts along a highway.
The energy saving is investigated by simulating smart lampposts that automatically turn on and off depending on whether a car is approaching. 

This project has been performed as an assignment for the course "Cyber Physical Systems" at the University of Twente.

### Requirements
This project depends on `matplotlib`, `numpy` and `click` for command-line interfacing.
